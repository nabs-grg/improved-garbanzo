# improved-garbanzo — Proposal for you 💕

A small React app built as a romantic proposal. Uses **Rspack** as the bundler.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

Start the dev server (app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Tech

- **React** — UI
- **Rspack** — bundler (fast, Rust-based)
- Plain CSS — no UI framework

Good luck with the proposal.
